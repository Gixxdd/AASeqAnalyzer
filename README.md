# AASeqAnalyzer
AASeqAnalyzer is a Python tool for analyzing amino acid sequences, classifying them into polar, non-polar, acidic, and basic categories. It counts the frequency of each type and displays the results in pie or bar charts, providing a quick, visual way to understand the chemical composition of protein sequences.

For the PPTM Analysis, this code uses the glossary from the TTU, which can be found here: https://www.ttuhsc.edu/medicine/academic-affairs/documents/sakai-files/bct/3_Protein_Structure_and_Properties1_Hardy.pdf.

This is an superficial analysis that can help you organize your thoughts.
